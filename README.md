## Bird Species Prediction Using Deep Learning
BIRD behavior and population trends have become an important issue now a days. Birds help us to detect other organisms in the environment (e.g. insects they feed on) easily as they respond quickly to the environmental changes. But, gathering and collecting information about birds requires huge human effort as well as becomes a very costlier method. In such case, a reliable system that will provide large scale processing of information about birds and will serve as a valuable tool for researchers, governmental agencies, etc. is required. So, bird species identification plays an important role in identifying that a particular image of bird belongs to which species. Bird species identification means predicting the bird species belongs to which category by using an image.

### About Dataset:
Data set of 525 bird species. 84635 training images, 2625 test images(5 images per species) and 2625 validation images(5 images per species. This is a very high quality dataset where there is only one bird in each image and the bird typically takes up at least 50% of the pixels in the image. As a result even a moderately complex model will achieve training and test accuracies in the mid 90% range.
